# üéØ START HERE - Slack Debugging Test Suite

**Your Slack buttons aren't working. Let's find out exactly why.**

---

## ‚ö° Quick Summary

We've created a comprehensive test suite with:
- **6 new test endpoints** (different configurations)
- **3 automated test scripts** (test everything)
- **5 test button types** (isolate the issue)
- **Complete documentation** (step-by-step guide)

**Time to complete**: 15-20 minutes  
**Result**: You'll know exactly what's wrong and how to fix it

---

## üöÄ Run These Commands (In Order)

### **Step 1: Deploy the Test Suite** (2 min)
```bash
cd /Users/will.bainbridge/CascadeProjects/ai-newsletter-pipeline\ copy/

git add .
git commit -m "Add comprehensive Slack debugging test suite"
git push origin main
```

Wait for Railway to deploy (check dashboard)

---

### **Step 2: Test Your Server** (1 min)
```bash
python3 test_slack_endpoints.py
```

**Expected**: All endpoints show ‚úÖ with 200 status

**If this fails**: Server issue, not Slack issue

---

### **Step 3: Check Slack App** (1 min)
```bash
python3 diagnose_slack_app.py
```

**Expected**: Bot token valid, scopes present, messages work

**If this fails**: Slack app configuration issue

---

### **Step 4: Send Test Buttons** (1 min)
```bash
python3 test_slack_buttons.py
```

**Then**: Go to your Slack channel and click each button

**Critical**: Test 2 (URL button) should ALWAYS work - it doesn't use webhooks

**If Test 2 fails**: App not properly installed to workspace

---

### **Step 5: Try URLs in Slack** (5 min)

Go to: https://api.slack.com/apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Interactivity & Shortcuts

**Open Railway logs in another window** (to see if requests come through)

Try each URL one by one:

1. `https://ai-newsletter-pipeline-production.up.railway.app/slack/simple`
2. `https://ai-newsletter-pipeline-production.up.railway.app/slack/minimal`
3. `https://ai-newsletter-pipeline-production.up.railway.app/slack/challenge`
4. `https://ai-newsletter-pipeline-production.up.railway.app/slack/interactions`

**For each URL**:
- Click "Save Changes"
- Write down the EXACT error message
- Check if ANY requests appear in Railway logs

---

### **Step 6: Report Results** (2 min)

Fill this out:

```
RESULTS:
‚úÖ Step 2 (Server endpoints): [ PASS / FAIL ]
‚úÖ Step 3 (Slack app config): [ PASS / FAIL ]
‚úÖ Step 4 (Test 2 URL button): [ WORKS / FAILS ]
‚úÖ Step 5 (Railway logs): [ REQUESTS SEEN / NO REQUESTS ]

Error when saving URL in Slack:
[PASTE EXACT ERROR MESSAGE]

If requests appeared in Railway logs:
[PASTE LOG EXCERPT]
```

## üîç Quick Diagnosis

Based on your results:

### **If Step 2 fails**
‚Üí Server/Railway configuration issue  
‚Üí Fix: Check Railway deployment, verify endpoints are accessible

### **If Step 3 fails**
‚Üí Slack app token or permissions issue  
‚Üí Fix: Verify bot token, check scopes, reinstall app

### **If Test 2 (URL button) fails**
‚Üí App not properly installed to workspace  
‚Üí Fix: Reinstall app, verify installation

### **If NO requests in Railway logs (Step 5)**
‚Üí **This is the key finding!**  
‚Üí Slack is not sending requests at all  
‚Üí This means: App configuration issue, NOT code issue  
‚Üí Fix: Add OAuth redirect URL or recreate app

### **If requests appear in logs but fail**
‚Üí Server responding incorrectly  
‚Üí Fix: Check log details, adjust response format

---

## üéØ Most Likely Issues & Fixes

### **Issue #1: Missing OAuth Redirect URL** (Most Common)

**Symptoms**: 
- No requests in Railway logs
- Same error for all URLs
- Error mentions "custom app" or "migrate"

**Fix**:
1. Go to: https://api.slack.com/apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí OAuth & Permissions
2. Add Redirect URL: `https://ai-newsletter-pipeline-production.up.railway.app/slack/oauth`
3. Click "Save URLs"
4. Go to "Install App" ‚Üí Click "Reinstall to Workspace"
5. Authorize the app
6. Go back to Interactivity & Shortcuts
7. Try configuring the URL again

---

### **Issue #2: App Not Created with Interactivity** (Common)

**Symptoms**:
- Error says "cannot handle interactive responses"
- App was created without interactivity enabled
- No way to enable it after creation

**Fix**: Recreate app from manifest
1. Go to: https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Click "Create New App"
3. Choose "From an app manifest"
4. Select your workspace
5. Paste contents of `slack_app_manifest.yaml`
6. Review and create
7. Install to workspace
8. Copy new tokens to `.env`:
   - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
   - `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
9. Test buttons

---

### **Issue #3: Signature Verification Blocking** (Less Common)

**Symptoms**:
- Requests appear in Railway logs
- Logs show "Invalid signature" errors
- Challenge response not working

**Fix**: Use `/slack/simple` endpoint (no auth)
- This endpoint has no signature verification
- If it works, we know auth is the issue
- Then fix signature verification in main endpoint

## üÜò Still Stuck?

If you've completed all steps and still have issues:

### **Alternative: Use Events API**
Events API is more reliable than interactive buttons:
1. Configure endpoint: `/slack/events`
2. Subscribe to events
3. Use slash commands instead of buttons

### **Alternative: Use Slash Commands**
Simpler than buttons:
1. Create command: `/add-to-pipeline [article-id]`
2. Much more reliable
3. Same functionality

## üéì What This Test Suite Does

**The Problem**: We don't know if the issue is:
- Server configuration
- Slack app configuration  
- Code/response format
- Network/connectivity
- Authentication

**The Solution**: Test each possibility systematically:
- Multiple endpoints (test different configs)
- Multiple button types (test different features)
- Automated scripts (test from outside)
- Manual testing (test in Slack UI)
- Log monitoring (see what Slack sends)

**The Result**: You'll know EXACTLY where the issue is and how to fix it.
