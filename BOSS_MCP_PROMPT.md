KEY WORKFLOWS:
1. MORNING ROUTINE: Check today's digest and key insights
2. WEEKLY CURATION: Review week's themes, search specific topics, mark articles for newsletter
3. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS: Track source quality and content trends

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES:
- Always start with daily_digests table for context
- Use natural language to translate business needs into database queries
- Focus on high-relevance articles (score 80+) for newsletter selection

## Overview
This database contains your AI newsletter pipeline data, organized for easy interaction via Claude's Supabase MCP integration. The system runs daily, collecting and processing AI/business articles, then creating daily digests with the top 5 most relevant articles.

## ðŸŽ¯ **START HERE - Your Primary Table: `daily_digests`**

**This is your main entry point.** Every day, the AI creates a comprehensive digest with:
- **5 carefully selected articles** from 50+ sources
- **AI-generated summary** of key themes
- **Key insights** highlighting important trends
- **Links to all selected articles**

### Essential Daily Queries

```sql
-- Today's digest (start here every morning)
SELECT * FROM daily_digests 
WHERE digest_date = CURRENT_DATE 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Last 7 days of digests
SELECT digest_date, summary_text, key_insights, 
       array_length(selected_article_ids, 1) as article_count
FROM daily_digests 
WHERE digest_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY digest_date DESC;

-- This week's digest overview
SELECT 
    digest_date,
    LEFT(summary_text, 150) || '...' as summary_preview,
    array_length(selected_article_ids, 1) as articles_selected,
    total_articles_processed
FROM daily_digests 
WHERE digest_date >= DATE_TRUNC('week', CURRENT_DATE)
ORDER BY digest_date DESC;
```

### Morning Routine (5 minutes)
```sql

SELECT digest_date, summary_text, key_insights 
FROM daily_digests 
WHERE digest_date = CURRENT_DATE;

-- 2. See today's selected articles

WHERE d.digest_date = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY a.relevance_score DESC;
```

### Weekly Newsletter Curation (15 minutes)
```sql
-- 1. See this week's top themes
SELECT digest_date, key_insights
FROM daily_digests 
WHERE digest_date >= DATE_TRUNC('week', CURRENT_DATE)
ORDER BY digest_date DESC;

SELECT title, source_name, relevance_score, url
FROM current_week_articles 
WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%vendor%' 
   OR LOWER(content_excerpt) LIKE '%lock-in%'
   OR 'vendor_lockin' = ANY(tags)
ORDER BY relevance_score DESC;

-- 3. Mark articles for newsletter (replace with actual IDs)
UPDATE articles 
SET selected_for_newsletter = TRUE, 
    newsletter_priority = 1,
    curator_notes = 'Lead story - excellent vendor lock-in analysis'
WHERE id = 'your-article-id-here';
```

### Performance Analysis (Monthly)
```sql
-- Source performance this month
SELECT 
    source_name,
    COUNT(*) as articles_collected,
    AVG(relevance_score) as avg_relevance,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE selected_for_newsletter) as newsletter_selected
FROM articles 
WHERE scraped_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY source_name
ORDER BY avg_relevance DESC;

-- Trending topics this month
